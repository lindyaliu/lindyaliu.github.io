                <p>Yet as our team was developing this concept, one question kept bothering me: <span class="emphasize-text">why should it be the role of Vancouver Fashion Week, an event organizer, to implement a creator’s hub</span> — especially when there were pre-existing services and resources of this kind?</p>
                <p>It occurred to me that our research insights surfaced what content creators valued in a solution, but our team was attempting to satisfy those creators simply by designing what they described at face value, resulting in an initial concept that differed from the nature of Vancouver Fashion Week.</p>
                <p>After presenting my arguments to our team, we agreed to re-work our concept proposal.</p>
