                <p>Vancouver Fashion Week was pleased with our project, taking our content suggestions to redesign their website <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.vanfashionweek.com/">www.vanfashionweek.com</a>, and on-boarded me as a marketing and social media intern the following summer.</p>
                <p>From this project, I learned how to effectively do deep-dive research within a limited amount of time while asking the right questions to drive and frame a project. While I still believe it was correct to pivot away from our initial concept <span class="emphasize-text">(the creator’s hub)</span>, there was potential in how it attempted to strengthen the way Vancouver Fashion Week facilitates networking and socialization between content creators and the fashion community during fashion events. We might have explored that project road more successfully had our team not falsely constrained ourselves to an exclusively online solution during the time, perhaps looking to hybrid “phy-gital” solutions as we recovered from the global pandemic.</p>
